excerpt: In collaboration with SPARC Europe, we today launch a survey to map Open Access (OA) and Open Science (OS) infrastructure across Europe. The aim is to establish a core understanding of Europe's current field of Open resources and gain insight into their usage, durability, and adherence to core open principles and standards.

In collaboration with [SPARC Europe](https://sparceurope.org/), we today [launch a survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/V8Q7R2X) to map Open Access (OA) and Open Science (OS) infrastructure across Europe. The aim is to establish a core understanding of Europe's current field of Open resources and gain insight into their usage, durability, and adherence to core open principles and standards.

This project is funded by the [Open Society Foundations](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/) (OSF), the world’s largest private funder of independent groups working for justice, democratic governance, and human rights. The funding will support a [1-year study of the European open infrastructure landscape](https://sparceurope.org/ioi-europe-invest-in-european-scholarly-communication-open-infrastructure/) and will help IOI gain insights into the state of open scholarly communications tooling and services in Europe.

The insights gained via this important survey, which is being conducted for the European OA and OS community and [Invest in Open Infrastructure](https://investinopen.org/) (IOI), will help inform discussions on how to secure these services in the future.

[From the SPARC Europe blog](https://sparceurope.org/new-survey-scoping-the-oa-and-os-infrastructure-landscape-in-europe/):

"Through this effort, we hope to bring greater visibility and a deeper understanding of the many European-based OA and OS services on offer,” said Vanessa Proudman, Director of SPARC Europe and member of the IOI Steering Group. “My engagement in Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI) is to ensure that this global approach is aware of and sensitive to the specifics of the European infrastructure and funding culture. We want to ensure that while we are reaching out and embracing lessons from across the globe, in our search for tangible and pragmatic solutions to funding Open infrastructure, Europe is addressed and considered. This new survey is the first step in this important process."

The survey will be open for responses through June 5, 2020.
